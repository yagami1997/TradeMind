# Cursor Engineering Rules v2.0

## Project Management Structure
- Use `project_management/control/MAIN_CONTROL.md` as the single source of truth for project status
- Follow standardized naming conventions for all reports:
  - Daily: `project_management/actuals/reports/daily/daily_report_YYYYMMDD.md`
  - Weekly: `project_management/actuals/reports/weekly/weekly_report_YYYYWNN.md` 
  - Decisions: `project_management/actuals/decisions/decision_DID.md`
- Update `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` for stakeholder-facing progress tracking
- Always use `./scripts/timestamp.sh` to generate consistent timestamps

## Code Development Standards
- Implement complete, production-ready code with proper error handling
- Maintain 80% code to 20% documentation ratio in implementation files
- Follow language-specific best practices (PEP8 for Python, etc.)
- Ensure unit test coverage for all new functionality (minimum 85%)
- Document public APIs with standardized docstrings
- Review code for security vulnerabilities before submission

## Workflow Optimization
- Use [CODE NOW] when analysis exceeds 5 minutes without concrete progress
- Implement [FOCUS] technique to establish clear context boundaries
- Apply [RESET] command to break circular reasoning patterns
- Use [DECISION] marker to document important engineering choices
- Follow "implement, test, refactor" development cycle
- Commit frequently with descriptive, atomic changes

## Task Execution Guidelines
- Define tasks with SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Break large tasks into sub-tasks of no more than 4 hours each
- Include verification methods and acceptance criteria for each task
- Link tasks to specific project requirements or objectives
- Document blockers and dependencies explicitly
- Set clear completion deadlines for all tasks

## Quality Assurance Practices
- Conduct peer code reviews for all significant changes
- Run static analysis tools before committing (linters, type checkers)
- Validate against performance benchmarks for critical components
- Document edge cases and their handling mechanisms
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly specified otherwise
- Create regression tests for all bug fixes
