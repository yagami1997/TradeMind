# Cursor Engineering Rules

## Project Structure
- Use project_management/control/MAIN_CONTROL.md as central control document
- Create daily reports in project_management/actuals/reports/daily/daily_report_YYYYMMDD.md
- Generate weekly reports in project_management/actuals/reports/weekly/weekly_report_weekN.md
- Track project progress in PROJECT_PROGRESS.md at root level
- Use templates from project_management/templates/ for creating new documents

## Code Generation
- Always produce complete, runnable code
- No placeholders or "to be implemented" sections
- 80% code, 20% explanation ratio
- Include error handling

## Anti-Patterns
- If analysis > 20% of time without code: STOP and CODE NOW
- No feature creep: stick to defined requirements
- Break circular thinking with [RESET] command
- No over-explanation: assume expert readers

## Commands
- [CODE NOW] - Stop analysis, start coding
- [FOCUS] - Limit context to specified scope
- [RESET] - Clear current approach and restart
- [DECISION] - Finalize a choice and move forward

## Task Format
- Clear deliverables and success criteria
- Time limits for completion
- Explicit context boundaries
- Sequential steps for implementation
