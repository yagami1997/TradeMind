# Cursor Engineering Rules v2.0


## Code Development Standards
- Implement complete, production-ready code with proper error handling
- Maintain 80% code to 20% documentation ratio in implementation files
- Follow language-specific best practices (PEP8 for Python, etc.)
- Ensure unit test coverage for all new functionality (minimum 85%)
- Document public APIs with standardized docstrings
- Review code for security vulnerabilities before submission

## Workflow Optimization
- Use [CODE NOW] when analysis exceeds 5 minutes without concrete progress
- Implement [FOCUS] technique to establish clear context boundaries
- Apply [RESET] command to break circular reasoning patterns
- Use [DECISION] marker to document important engineering choices
- Follow "implement, test, refactor" development cycle
- Commit frequently with descriptive, atomic changes

## Task Execution Guidelines
- Define tasks with SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Break large tasks into sub-tasks of no more than 4 hours each
- Include verification methods and acceptance criteria for each task
- Link tasks to specific project requirements or objectives
- Document blockers and dependencies explicitly
- Set clear completion deadlines for all tasks

## Quality Assurance Practices
- Conduct peer code reviews for all significant changes
- Run static analysis tools before committing (linters, type checkers)
- Validate against performance benchmarks for critical components
- Document edge cases and their handling mechanisms
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly specified otherwise
- Create regression tests for all bug fixes

## Documentation and Timestamp Standards
- ALWAYS use scripts/generate_timestamp.py to generate timestamps for documentation
- NEVER manually type timestamps in any project documentation files
- Run generate_timestamp.py before updating any "last updated" fields
- Use format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ' for all timestamps in documentation
- Include timestamp generation in documentation update checklist
- Verify timestamp format consistency across all project documents
